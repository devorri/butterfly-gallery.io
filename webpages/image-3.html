            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Starting your day by saying good things to yourself. This artwork illustrates the meaning of loving yourself. Practicing Self-love is important to all people who wants to improve their well-being. In other words, be kind to yourself. As a person, self-love is hard to achieve if you experience being criticized and judged by other people for simply doing the things you love. But being aware of how to appreciate oneself can impact on our physical, psychological, and spiritual growth. Furthermore, life is full of challenges and taking care of yourself is part of the change we must embrace.

                Self-love can start by being true to yourself and prioritizing yourself as much as we show love to others. Accepting your imperfections and giving yourself a break from self-judgement was also a step. One step at a time. Donâ€™t rush. We are all aware that the hardest thing to overcome is ourselves. So, stop thinking and start doing things to have a better future.</p>
